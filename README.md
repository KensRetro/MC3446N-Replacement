A replacement for the no longer manufactured MC3446 IC.  Not exactly the same spec but unless you are loading it down with many connections you'll never notice.

The module is simple and most of the time fits right into the socket if there's enough clearance.
The circuit mimics the internals of the original chip and has been tested in a PET computer with great success.

Very few parts needed to assemble the board.  It is recommended to mount the board at the TOP of the pins (or shear off the pins) so the 
surface mount components will sit correctly.  Minimal surface mount soldering is needed, a little care and patience goes a long way.
